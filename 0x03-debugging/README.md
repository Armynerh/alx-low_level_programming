C - Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
The important thing is that you explain your problem to this object of (one-sided) conversation. Follow the steps:

Explain your (broken) code and its goals, generally. Don’t worry about details, just set the context for your duck.
Line-by-line, explain what the flow of the whole function or method that’s not working is. Don’t skip details, ducks love details!
If your duck friend hasn’t spotted it yet, be sure to explain all the intermediate states and transitions in detail.
Find your (stupid, obvious) solution! The reason we so love “rubber duck debugging” is that (typically) in the process of doing this, you’ll find your problem. You made a small typo. You were operating on the wrong variable. Your if condition was checking the opposite of what you thought. Something is likely to be revealed.
